# Salary-Prediction

## Define
The objective of Salary Prediction project are to perfrom EDA, create models and  uncover factors that contribute most to the salary

## Discover
Tools Used : Google Colab

Packages : pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

Directories : datasets - test, train data used in the project, images - Graphs of EDA and models

**Data**

train_features.csv: Each row represents an observation. There are 1 milion records and 9 features and the "jobId" column is unique to each observation. 

train-salaries.csv: Each row is a unique  with jobID and its corresponding salary. The file is combined with train_features.csv to train the machine learning models.

test_features.csv: Similar to train_features.csv except it is missing salary which will be predicted by the models.  

**Features**

jobId : Unique identifier for each job posting.

companyId : Unique identifier for each company posting the job position.

jobType : Type of job position. It contains 8 different categories - CEO, CFO, CTO, Janitor, Junior, Manager, Senior, Vice President.

industry : Job field. It contains 7 different categories - Health, Web, Auto, Finance, Education, Oil, Service.
		   
degree : Highest eduction obtained. It consists 5 different categories - None, High School, Bachelor's, Master's, Doctoral.
		   
major : Degree major. It contains  9 unique categories - None, Literature, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science, Math, Business, Engineering.
		   
yearsExperience : Experience in years.

milesFromMetropolis : Distance from the Metropolitan city, in miles. 

salary : Target variable. Salary paid in thousands US dollars.

*EDA shows that features - job type, degree, major, industry, years of experience impact salary positively. Miles from metrolpolis is negatively correlated and company is not correlated.*


## Devlop


**Baseline Model**

Developed a simple baseline model with Mean Squared Error(MSE) between salary and features, jobType and industry. 

MSE with industry : **1367.12**

MSE with jobType : **963.93**

Goal is to develop models with reduced MSE values. 



**Models**
- Linear Regression

- Random Forest

- Gradient Boosting

**Model Evaluation**
Below table shows the MSE and R-sqaured for each model.

## Deploy
The best model is **Gradient Boosting Regressor** have the lowest MSE and highest R-sqaured value, it is thus selected for the deployment for test set. 

Predicted salary is being saved as predicted_salary.csv.

**Feature Importance**

Below bargraph shows the important features in descending order. The years of experience is the factor that contributes most for prediction of salary for the given post. Other features such as distance from the metropolis, job type and degree are also important.
